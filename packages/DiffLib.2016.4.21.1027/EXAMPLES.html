<a href="https://github.com/lassevk/DiffLib">repository</a> requires <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> to run, a free tool made
by the author of <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/">C# 4.0 in a Nutshell</a>, a <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>
book about C# 4.0, LINQ and various other topics.</p>

<p>Note that you need <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> version 4.27.1 or higher.</p>

<p>Ensure that you load up the solution file in Visual Studio 2010
or above and do a full rebuild for the Debug target before testing
any of the examples. They rely on the binary produced as part of the
build output.</p>
